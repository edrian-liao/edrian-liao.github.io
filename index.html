            <p>🇵🇭 <b>Proud Filipino: </b> I am a low-income international student from the Philippines who once dreamt of pursuing tertiary education outside of the country. Fortunately, I am now here at Duke 
                with a full-ride scholarship <a href="https://ousf.duke.edu/merit-scholarships/karsh-international-scholars-program/">(Karsh Scholar)</a> proving that the <a href="https://medium.com/@jodielovesmaths/what-is-a-limit-and-when-does-it-not-exist-1f50a08c210c">
                    limit does not exist.</a></p>
            <p>🎓 <b>ECE, CS, Math:</b> I am currently a junior pursuing a double major in electrical and computer engineering and computer science with a concentration in machine learning and artificial intelligence and a minor in mathematics.</p>
            <p>👨🏽‍💻 <b>Code for Good:</b> Where I come from, technology is not as accessible. That is why I am interested in leveraging technology for the common good. No matter how small my projects are, I try to do whatever I can to be of help.</p>
            <p>🌏 <b>Climate Justice:</b> This summer, I started my project named PlanetTales that aims to share stories about the impacts of climate change to the most remote and vulnerable areas of the world, stories not only shared with words but also images, videos, 
                and data to encapsulate and give justice to people’s experiences. Funded by my scholarship, my project's first stop was my hometown in the Philippines.</p>
            
            <h2>Teaching 🍎</h2>
            <p>I have been a teaching assistant for ECE 110L: Fundamentals of Electrical and Computer Engineering taught by <a href="https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/lisa-huettel">Prof. Lisa Huettel</a> at Duke University and have been writing open-source 
                handouts ✍🏽 or feedback to students. Although these documents are specifically tailored for students, feel free to take a look at them.</p>
